I wanted to buy from Apple, but the cheapest refurbished watch they had was $339.00 and I'm just unwilling to pay those prices for a watch. I had a Series 2 from January 2018 - fall 2021, when the watch face simple fell open (I was appalled but I don't blame the watch, I wore it all day every day during that period of time. It got me through 60 lb weight loss, I'm surprised it made it that long).Watch arrived today. I will note that it took a really long time to charge. That is the con here, it took about an hour to charge to 68% which suggests that either - it takes Series 4 longer to charge, or there may be a battery issue here.Besides that, the watch is in great condition. There is one tiny ding at the very top of the watch. You only notice it if you have your eyeball an inch from the watch, like I did. Otherwise, no scratches or defects on the watch screen or in the watch when it is powered up (I saw others had dots or other irregularities in their refurbished watch screens - none on this one). The watch set up and paired to my phone without any problems. I have been unable to set up cellular - I keep getting an error. This may be an AT&T issue, I'm not sure yet. Despite this being a 4 year old watch, it doesn't feel like a 4 year old watch. It's new TO ME. I like the new features (ECG, the slightly bigger screen DOES make a difference .. I always put my passcode in wrong at least 2x with the Series 2, with this that issue is gone).I'll revisit this review after I've had it a while, or uncovered answers to any of my other issues. As a note, my seller was The Camera Guyz in Brooklyn NY. My delivery date was initially towards the end of next week, next Thursday (I ordered yesterday, Friday)... watch came within 24 hours.\nRead more","date":"Reviewed in the United States on July 30, 2022","verified":"Verified Purchase"}]},{"Title":"Apple Watch Series 9 [GPS 41mm] Smartwatch with Storm Blue Aluminum Case with Silver Sport Band M\/L.

Took forever to refresh and I couldn\u2019t even see weather or sleep.Apple Watch is amazing. It\u2019s beautiful. It lasts thru a night of sleep and a run per day. Charges fast. I can make calls and messages from my wrist and place emergency calls. I\u2019m never without my phone so I don\u2019t need cellular, it functions via Bluetooth. I can control what\u2019s playing from my wrist, see stocks, check email if needed, track mood, and I set up my watch face for ultimate self help using the \u201cI Am\u201d affirmations app. Also, heart rate to remember I\u2019m alive, bear app which is notes with voice dictation (works great), voice note and mindfulness (which has mindful modules but also log your mood\/state with detailed emotion options). It\u2019s really great. The watch just WORKS. Makes Fitbit look like a hunk of garbage. I feel safer too since watch has fall detection (I\u2019m a runner), tracks location on find my phone for my parents, has photos (I can view up to 500 so I keep an SOS mental health folder of images and snippet that calm me down), maps (really important for walking without phone out). The alarm is great, best of all it syncs perfectly with my phone so if I have maps on my phone on silent I still get a buzz before directions so I can mute instructions but not have to look down at phone wondering when my next turn is. Has reminders app, audible, cycle tracking. The Apple health app is a league above anything I\u2019ve ever seen.The exercise app gives a huge amount of data for running (cadence, heart rate, elevation gain and loss, pace) and you can use other apps while during a workout ie check messages or place call during a long run.It has great sleep data and is much more accurate than Fitbit who tries to make you pay for same data. Fitbit even erased the community function while Apple fitness allows you to see others workout and compete.Love!!Update- I got an otterbox pink\/red watch case and Lerobo wine red watch band. Loving it- the original band is okay but I prefer to customize and this is more comfortable.\nRead more","date":"Reviewed in the United States on December 7, 2023","verified":"Verified Purchase"}]},{"Title":"Apple Watch Series 6 (GPS, 40mm) - Silver Aluminum Case with White Sport Band (Renewed)","Rating":"4.1 out of 5 stars","Price":"$154.00","Image URL":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71b84TN1RgL.__AC_SX300_SY300_QL70_ML2_.jpg","Description":" \n About this item    LEAVE YOUR PHONE IN YOUR POCKET: Apple Watch Series 6 GPS Model lets you call, text, and get directions from your wrist, while leaving your phone in your pocket.

The seller even upgraded my watch to the cellular version at no extra charge! That was a nice surprise, and now I\u2019ll have that option if I ever want it without having to buy a new watch.  It was easy to set up and link with my Apple account. The charger that came with the watch gets extremely hot when charging, so I did buy a new charging station that can charge my phone and watch at the same time. So far I get about a day and a half of wear time before I have to charge it. There are some functions of the Apple Watch that I don\u2019t love, but that has nothing to do with this seller or this particular watch; overall this watch is in perfect condition and works as it should.\nRead more","date":"Reviewed in the United States on May 28, 2024","verified":"Verified Purchase"}]},{"Title":"Apple Watch SE (2nd Gen) [GPS + Cellular 40mm] Smartwatch with Starlight Aluminum Case with Starlight Sport Band S\/M.

I watched some YouTube how-to videos before it arrived, and this paid off well.It arrived in the original box, but the strap had been attached-so I knew from the videos I watched that someone had at least tried it on.  I was actually glad the strap was attached as that was one less thing for me to do. The charging cord was in its original sealed bag, so it was brand new.The watch took about an hour to charge to the point that I could set it up. The set up was easy and fast. Having watched a few how-to videos before it arrived, made the set up effortless for me, and I am no techie.From the videos I had seen I knew to check to see if the software needed updating (it did) and if the battery had the ability to charge to 100% since it was a refurbished watch. I was relieved to see that the battery could be charged to 100%. If that had not been the case, I planned to send it back during the no shipping cost to return time.Well, I love the watch. Learning to use its basic features took little time. It\u2019s a sophisticated watch and, with a plethora of available apps, it can help in many ways. So I keep learning more about using its many features. I bought a HeartWatch and an AutoSleep app which perfectly meet my needs. Each were under $10 for lifetime use \u2013 no subscription fees, no advertisements and they work amazingly well. Some of the other apps look questionable from their reviews. Subscription fees add up quickly, so I am avoiding all that completely without missing out on anything I want, so far.This watch has me exercising much more than I thought I was able to, feeling better and sometimes sleeping better. I wish I had bought one sooner.Update several weeks in: The pretty pink watch band is light and gets dirty very quickly. It is comfortable and easy to take on and off. I\u2019m going to get a band in another color. The watch continues to work great and keeps helping me improve my fitness and sleep.\nRead more","date":"Reviewed in the United States on June 13, 2024","verified":"Verified Purchase"}]},{"Title":"Apple Watch SE (GPS, 40mm) - Gold Aluminum Case with Pink Sand Sport Band (Renewed)","Rating":"4.4 out of 5 stars","Price":"$149.99","Image URL":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/I\/81XIJVqW-2L.__AC_SX300_SY300_QL70_ML2_.jpg","Description":" \n About this item    LEAVE YOUR PHONE IN YOUR POCKET: Apple Watch SE GPS Model lets you call, text, and get directions from your wrist, while leaving your phone in your pocket.
